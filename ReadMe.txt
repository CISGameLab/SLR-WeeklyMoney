Weekly Money is a game based off of a Bridge Card system simulator in Second Life.

Detailed instructions of how to play are on the game, however, the short version:
You must try to survive as long as you can on your Bridge Card. Buying food and toiletries is necessary, as is gas.
See how well you could do surviving on as little as possible each month.
